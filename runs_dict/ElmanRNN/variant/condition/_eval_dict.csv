column,human_readable,description
mode,Evaluation mode,"One of {open, replay, prediction, closed}. Determines how outputs were generated (teacher-forced vs noisy drive vs free rollouts)." 
ckpt,Checkpoint path,"Full path to the evaluated checkpoint (.pth.tar)."
data,External data path,"If open-loop used an external dataset, this is its path; empty otherwise."
noise_scale,Noise SD (replay/prediction),"Standard deviation of Gaussian noise used to drive inputs in replay or the non-prefix part of prediction (unitless)."
prefix_T,Teacher-forced warmup length,"Number of initial time steps driven by the ground-truth input (prediction/closed)."
div_thresh_deg,Divergence threshold (deg),"Angular error threshold (degrees) used to declare divergence (prediction/closed)."
div_consec,Consecutive steps to diverge,"How many consecutive time steps must exceed the threshold to count as divergence."
feedback_norm,Feedback normalization,"How outputs are mapped back to inputs during closed-loop rollouts: {prob, none}."
free_steps,Closed-loop steps,"Length of autonomous rollout after the warm-up in closed-loop evaluation."
mse,Mean squared error,"Mean over batch×time×features of (target - output)^2."
mean_corr,Mean feature correlation,"Mean Pearson r across features after flattening batch×time."
angle_error_R,Angle error concentration R,"Resultant-length concentration of phase error Δθ; higher is better (1=perfect, 0=uniform)."
angle_error_circ_var,Circular variance of angle error,"1 - R; lower is better."
residual_lag1_autocorr,Residual lag-1 autocorrelation,"Lag-1 autocorrelation of stepwise residual norms."
residual_L2_mean,Mean residual L2,"Mean L2 norm of (Target-Output) across time and batch."
ring_decode_R2,R^2 for ring variable decode,"Linear (ridge) decode of [cosθ, sinθ] from model outputs; mean R^2 of the two heads."
time_to_divergence,Time-to-divergence (steps),"First time the mean |Δθ| stays ≥ threshold for div_consec steps; None/blank if not reached."
phase_drift_per_step,Phase drift per step,"Slope (rad/step) of the unwrapped mean signed Δθ over time."
mse_free,MSE (free segment),"MSE computed only on the autonomous (free) part of a closed-loop rollout; blank for other modes."
mean_corr_free,Mean corr (free segment),"Mean feature correlation on the free segment (closed-loop only)."
angle_error_R_free,Angle error R (free),"R computed on free segment (closed-loop only)."
angle_error_circ_var_free,Circular variance (free),"1-R on the free segment (closed-loop only)."
residual_lag1_autocorr_free,Residual lag-1 autocorr (free),"Lag-1 autocorr of residual norms on free segment (closed-loop only)."
residual_L2_mean_free,Mean residual L2 (free),"Mean residual L2 on free segment (closed-loop only)."
ring_decode_R2_free,R^2 ring decode (free),"Mean R^2 for [cosθ, sinθ] decode on free segment (closed-loop only)."
